# Full Stack Web Application
* **Objective** - to create an implementation of a web service
* **Purpose** - to demonstrate the construction of a full-stacked web-application
* **Description**
	* This Case Study is my first foray into building a full-stack application. I was able to demonstrate how to use Spring MVC to develop a simple todo-list web application.
	* This project was exciting! Thanks to my classmates, my instructor (Leon Hunter), for all the learning and applying what I've learned into building something amazing.
