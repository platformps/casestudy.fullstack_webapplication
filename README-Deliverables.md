- After registration, a user will be able to login and access a board representing the user added income and spendings.
- The user will be able to add, update, and delete income and spendings directly on the board.
- The user will be able to organize spendings by category, each category will have a partial summary and the final summary will be provided at the end of the webpage. 
- The user will be able to logout when done using the application.
