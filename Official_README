#Home Page
The home page for the app is the create registration form. The information is submitted through the Angular reactive form and persisted to the database.

#Admin Section
When an admin needs to view all the registrations or even a specific registration they would siply navigate to localhost:4200/admin and they would be able to access all the registrations that have been persisted. Each name is link that will call a function to pull all the deatails of that specific registration.
